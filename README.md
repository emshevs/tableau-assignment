# Citi Bike Analysis - Tableau Assignment

In this assignment I am the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program and responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. 

Here I will provide my report to city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. 

## Steps 

Firstly, I used pandas to combine data from the bike sharing service in the Summer of 2019 for the months of June, July and August. 

Secondly, I analyzed the data and discovered two phenomena: 

    1. That the bike sharing program is mainly being used by subscription users (majority males) for their commute to and from work (as most popular stations are located to transit hubs) whereas customer users are using the bike share program for more recreational use. 

    2. There is much work to be done to promote more women to the service (particularly as subscribers) as the data shows the rideshare program to be predominantly used by males in their 30s or 40s. 

Lastly, I have put together two dashboards - one analyzing the different Citi bike usage patterns between Subscribers vs. Customers and the second analyzing the demoraphic information of service users to better inform future decisions. 

The entire analysis can be found in summary through a final story.
